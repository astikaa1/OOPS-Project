MAKING YOUR NOTES AND GIVING A QUIZ FROM IT:

The user is required to submit notes.

The notes in the predefined format will be saved in the program database. Linked Lists have been used for this part of the Project After the submitting the notes the user can attempt a quiz from the submitted data.

The quiz is an interactive quiz wherein, incase the user doesn't know the answer, he can use hints just the way it is done in a popular game called Hangman

The next part of the project is the game called Brain Teaser, wherein the user is shown a set of 6 numbers for 6 seconds. He/She needs to memorize them and type them in the reverse order.
